        <p>
          Everyone in our community deserves and should expect to feel safe and
          welcome at our events, in our space, and with our staff. By
          establishing a code of conduct The Shortcut is able to create an
          environment that is happy, safe, accepting, and for everyone. This
          code of conduct outlines The Shortcut’s expectations regarding
          employee, intern, volunteer, community member and event attendee’s
          conduct. Any breach of these principles will lead to disciplinary
          action.
