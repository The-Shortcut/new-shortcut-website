          The Shortcut supports talent in establishing a career in Finland and
          accelerating their entry into the Finnish technology industry. As the
          biggest talent accelerator in the Nordics and one of the biggest
          not-for-profit talent accelerators in the world, we’re committed to
          connecting talent with startups and high-growth companies, or
          encouraging talent to consider founding a startup of their own. We do
          this through events, workshops, training sessions and internships.

      <AccItem key={2} question="How is The Shortcut funded?">
        <p>
          The Shortcut is self-financed through donations, foundations grants,
          service provision and private partnerships.

      <AccItem key={3} question="When was The Shortcut founded?">
        <p>
          Back in 2016, The Shortcut started as a two person team visiting
          refugee centres with a grassroot volunteer movement. We encouraged
          people to consider startups and entrepreneurship as a way of
          integrating into Finnish society faster. Now, we’ve grown into a fully
          funded organisation with over 30 team members who are determined to
          accelerate talent into employment — including you!

        question="I’m looking to start a career in Finland. What can The Shortcut do for me?"
      >
        <p>
          We aim to help you optimise your skills and accelerate your entry into
          the Finnish job market by offering services and organising activities
          designed to help you adapt and upgrade your skills to gain a
          competitive advantage in the Finnish job market; these activities
          cover a wide range of topics from soft skills (how to write an
          effective CV, personal branding, networking) to technical skills
          necessary for the digital world we live in (coding languages, data and
          growth hacking, inbound sales and marketing, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          In short, we want to give you — our community — access to the soft and
          hard skills necessary to thrive in the Finnish tech industry. We offer
          our community the opportunity to build a network, as well as a
          springboard to be seen through The Shortcut’s connections in the
          Finnish startup ecosystem — almost every three out of four jobs in
          Finland are never advertised. Having the right connections in the
          field can open the door to opportunities you never even knew about!

          We are here to be the springboard for your startup or business
          venture. We organise activities aimed at people just like you, who
          want to see their business idea come to life. Our workshops aim to
          help participants turn an idea into a viable business proposal through
          coaching, hands-on guiding, and of course the ever-so-important
          networking opportunities.

        <p>
          The Shortcut is part of the Startup Foundation Sr., founded in 2012 by
          Finnish tech influencers, entrepreneurs, and investors. The Startup
          Foundation works to build the Nordic region towards a leading global
          startup ecosystem. Our sister organisations are Slush, Junction, Wave
          Ventures, AaltoES, Kiuas, Startuplifers, HelTech, FallUp, Dash and
          Maria01.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are a non profit organisation 100% owned by Startup Foundation. No
          individuals or companies have shares, equity or receive dividends. All
          proceeds fund our core operations.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The Shortcut is a kick-ass and diverse community of full time staff
          members, interns and international talent. We all share the same
          mission: supporting each other in our pursuit of employment,
          entrepreneurship and giving back.

        question="Can I join The Shortcut even if I don’t have experience in tech?"
      >
        <p>
          Tech startups and high growth companies need people with a diverse
          skill set and background to bring growth — that means we need talent
          with experience in human resources, sales, product development,
          digital marketing, etc. At The Shortcut, we strive to encourage people
          to not only enhance their skills, but to transfer and update their
          skills to serve the growing Finnish tech sector and to give them a
          chance to re-invent their career; so of course, you’re more than
          welcome to join our events regardless of background! Take a look at
          our current events or workshops to see if anything sparks your
          interest.
