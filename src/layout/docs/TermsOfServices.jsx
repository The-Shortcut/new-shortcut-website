          to one of our events. If you contact our customer service, we will use
          the information provided by you to answer your questions or solve your
          complaint. In order to ensure that our services are in line with your

          consent to that.
        </p>
        <h4>For quality improvement and trend analysis</h4>
        <p>
          We may also process information about your use of the services to
          improve the quality of our services e.g. by analyzing any trends in
          the use of our services. When possible, we will do this using only
          aggregated, non-personally identifiable data.
        </p>
        <h4>Legitimate grounds for processing</h4>
        <p>
          The Shortcut processes your personal data to perform our contractual

          provisions of the standard contractual clauses adopted by the European
          Commission. If you wish to know more about international transfers of
          your personal data, you may contact us via the contact details above.
